  # Optional - An ordered list of JSON Web Token (JWT) claims to use when Galasa sets the requestor of a test.
  # The first JWT claim that is matched will be used as the requestor of a test.
  #
  # For example, given a JWT that includes the following claims:
  # {
  #   "iss": "https://example.com/dex",
  #   "sub": "my-user-id",
  #   "aud": "my-client",
  #   "exp": 1234567890,
  #   "iat": 1234567890,
  #   "name": "John Doe",
  #   "preferred_username": "johndoe"
  # }
  #
  # If the `usernameClaims` value is set to:
  #
  # usernameClaims:
  #   - name
  #   - preferred_username
  #   - sub
  #
  # then the "name" claim will be matched first, and the value "John Doe" will be taken as the requestor of a test.
  #
  # By default, the order that will be applied is as follows:
  # 1. "preferred_username"
  # 2. "name"
  # 3. "sub"
  #
  # Different Dex connectors may return different claims within issued JWTs. For details on which JWT claims are
